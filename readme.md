##The MACM Software

**Note:** The software is over 10 years old and more modern software could implement the concept more easily and securely.  This github distribution was setup on January 3, 2014 and is being maintained as part of the agreement with the *Perspectives on Economic Education Research* to keep the software available, as referenced in the article.  The web address published in the article now points to this github project instead of the original website at Miami University.

###Purpose###
This web tool has been used to teach students about the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and is based on work by Prof. Paul Adams (Univ. of Cincinnati), Prof. Brian Kluger (Univ. of Cincinnati), and Prof. Mark E. McBride (Miami University). Students are given portfolios of a set of risky assets. Each round the students can place limit orders in call markets for each asset. At the end of the experiment, the realize valued of the assets can be determined using any random process the instructor wishes (e.g., a bingo cage drawing of random numbers). The realized value of the assets can be entered and the final value of student portfolios are calculated.

###Usage###
The software is available for non-commerical use by instructors. The software is written using the freely available open-source code of PHP and MySQL. Installation of the software on a web server that supports PHP and MySQL involves moving the files to a directory on the web server, changing one configuration file, and accessing a web page.

For sample screen shots, see the instructions in the Resources section of the distribution.

###Updates###

####PEER Article (July 24, 2006)
An article describing MACM and its use in the classroom has been published by [Perspectives on Economics Education Research](http://www.isu.edu/peer/) 

####Classroom Based Version (Sept. 1, 2005)

Excel spreadsheets to assist running a double oral auction version of the multiple asset call market are now available as part of the distribution. These files (DA4asset.xls, Trader1.xls) allow the instructor to setup and run the experiment during class. See the downloads area to get the files.

####Updated Versions (May 21, 2003)

An updated version of the software has been posted. The new version fixes some small bugs, improves and simplifies the installation process, and adds the ability to upload new experiments from a text file.

####FMA Teaching Innovation Award (Oct. 22, 2000)

A version of the experiments used in teaching the CAPM model won the Best Innovation in Teaching Finance Paper Award from the Financial Management Association for the year 2000.
